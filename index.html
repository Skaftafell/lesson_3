        <mark>Chapter One </mark> My name is Kathy H. I’m thirty-one years old,
        and I’ve been a carer now for over eleven years. That sounds long
        enough, I know, but actually they want me to go on for another eight
        months, until the end of this year. That’ll make it almost exactly
        twelve years. Now I know my being a carer so long isn’t necessarily
        because they think I’m fantastic at what I do. There are some really
        good carers who’ve been told to stop after just two or three years.
      </p>
      <p class="ki__three">
        And I can think of one carer at least who went on for all of fourteen
        years despite being a complete waste of space. So I’m not trying to
        boast. But then I do know for a fact they’ve been pleased with my work,
        and by and large, I have too. My donors have always tended to do much
        better than expected. Their recovery times have been impressive, and
        hardly any of them have been classified as “agitated,” even before
        fourth donation. Okay, maybe I am boasting now. But it means a lot to
        me, being able to do my work well, especially that bit about my donors
        staying “calm.”
      </p>
      <p class="ki__four">
        I’ve developed a kind of instinct around donors. I know when to hang
        around and comfort them, when to leave them to themselves; when to
        listen to everything they have to say, and when just to shrug and tell
        them to snap out of it.

        <mark>He was </mark> an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf
        Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In
        the first forty days a boy had been with him. But after forty days
        without a fish the boy's parents had told him that the old man was now
        definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and
        the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good
        fish the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each
        day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry
        either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was
        furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and,
        furled, it looked like the flag of permanent defeat.
      </p>
      <p class="eg__three">
        The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his
        neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings
        from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches
        ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased
        scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars
        were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
      </p>
      <p class="eg__four">
        Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same
        color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated. ''Santiago,'' the boy
        said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up.
        ''I could go with you again. We've made some money.'' The old man had
        taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him. ''No,'' the old man said.
        ''You're with a lucky boat. Stay with them.''

        <mark>It was </mark> a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were
        striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an
        effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors
        of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of
        gritty dust from entering along with him.
      </p>
      <p class="do__three">
        The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a
        coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the
        wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the
        face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and
        ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use
        trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at
        present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was
        part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was
        seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose
        ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the
        way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the
        enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which
        are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG
        BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.
      </p>
      <p class="do__four">
        Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which
        had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from
        an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the
        surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice
        sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The
        instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there
        was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a
        smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by
        the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very
        fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and
        blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.
